Lab 10-2: Using Inheritance to Create a Derived Class in C++

Learning Objectives: 10.1–10.2

In this lab, you create a derived class from a base class, and then use the derived class in a C++ program.
The program should create two Motorcycle objects, and then set the Motorcycle’s speed, accelerate
the Motorcycle object, and check its sidecar status. Use the Vehicle and Automobile classes that you
worked with earlier in this chapter as a guide.

1. Open the file named Motorcycle.cpp using Notepad or the text editor of your choice.
2. Create the Motorcycle class by deriving it from the Vehicle class. Use a public derivation.
3. In the Motorcycle class, create a private attribute named sidecar. The sidecar attribute
should be data type bool.
4. Write a public set method to set the value for sidecar.
5. Write a public get method to retrieve the value of sidecar.
6. Write a public accelerate() method. This method overrides the accelerate() method
inherited from the Vehicle class. Change the message in the accelerate() method so the
following is displayed when the Motorcycle tries to accelerate beyond its maximum speed:
"This motorcycle cannot go that fast".
7. Save this class file, Motorcycle.cpp, in a directory of your choice, and then open the file named
MyMotorcycleClassProgram.cpp.
8. In the MyMotorcycleClassProgram, create two Motorcycle objects named motorcycleOne
and motorcycleTwo.
9. Set the sidecar value of motorcycleOne to true and the sidecar value of motorcycleTwo to
false.
10. Set motorcycleOne’s maximum speed to 90 and motorcycleTwo’s maximum speed to 85.
11. Set motorcycleOne’s current speed to 65 and motorcycleTwo’s current speed to 60.
12. Accelerate motorcycleOne by 30 mph, and accelerate motorcycleTwo by 20 mph.
13. Print the current speed of motorcycleOne and motorcycleTwo.
14. Determine if motorcycleOne and motorcycleTwo have sidecars. If yes, display the following:
"This motorcycle has a side car". If not, display the following: "This motorcycle does
not have a side car".
15. Save MyMotorcycleClassProgram.cpp in the same directory as Motorcycle.cpp.
16. Compile the source code file MyMotorcycleClassProgram.cpp.
17. Execute the program.
18. Record the output below.
