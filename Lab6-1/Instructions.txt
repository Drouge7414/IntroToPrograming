Lab 6-1: Array Basics

Learning Objective: 6.1

In this lab, you complete a partially prewritten C++ program that uses an array. The program prompts the user
to interactively enter eight batting averages, which the program stores in an array. The program should then
find the minimum and maximum batting average stored in the array as well as the average of the eight bat
ting averages. The data file provided for this lab includes the input statement and some variable declarations.
Comments are included in the file to help you write the remainder of the program.

-

1. Open the source code file named BattingAverage.cpp using Notepad or the text editor of your
choice.
2. Write the C++ statements as indicated by the comments.
3. Save this source code file in a directory of your choice, and then make that directory your working
directory.
4. Compile the source code file BattingAverage.cpp.
5. Execute the program. Enter the following batting averages: .299, .157, .242, .203, .198,
.333, .270, .190. The minimum batting average should be 0.157, and the maximum batting
average should be 0.333. The average should be 0.2365.
