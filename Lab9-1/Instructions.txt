In this lab, you complete a partially prewritten C++ program that includes functions with no parameters.
The program asks the user if he or she has preregistered for tickets to an art show. If the user has
preregistered, the program should call a function named discount() that displays the message, "You are
preregistered and qualify for a 5 percent discount." If the user has not preregistered, the
program should call a function named noDiscount() that displays the message, "Sorry, you did not
preregister and do not qualify for a 5 percent discount." The source code file provided
for this lab includes the necessary variable declarations and the input statement. Comments are included in
the file to help you write the remainder of the program.

1. Open the source code file named ArtShowDiscount.cpp using Notepad or the text editor of your
choice.
2. Write the C++ statements as indicated by the comments.
3. Save this source code file in a directory of your choice, and then make that directory your working
directory.
4. Compile the source code file, ArtShowDiscount.cpp.
5. Execute the program.
