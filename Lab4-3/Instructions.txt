Lab 4-3: Understanding Nested if Statements

Learning Objectives: 4.1, 4.3

In this lab, you complete a prewritten C++ program that calculates an employee’s productivity bonus and
prints the employee’s name and bonus. Bonuses are calculated based on an employee’s productivity score as
shown in Table 4-4. A productivity score is calculated by first dividing an employee’s transactions dollar value
by the number of transactions and then dividing the result by the number of shifts worked.

Table 4-4 Employee productivity scores and bonuses

Productivity Score Bonus

<=30 $50
31–69 $75
70–199 $100
>= 200 $200


1. Open the file named EmployeeBonus.cpp using Notepad or the text editor of your choice.
2. Variables have been declared for you, and the input statements and output statements have been
written. Read them over carefully before you proceed to the next step.
3. Design the logic, and write the rest of the program using a nested if statement.
4. Compile the program.
5. Execute the program and enter the following as input:
Employee’s first name: Kim Smith
Number of shifts: 25
Number of transactions: 75
Transaction dollar value: 40000.00
6. Your output should be: Employee Name: Kim Smith
Employee Bonus: $50
