Lab 2-1: Declaring and Initializing C++ Variables
Learning Objective: 2.2

In this lab, you declare and initialize variables in a C++ program provided with the data files for this book.
The program, which is saved in a file named NewAge.cpp, calculates your age in the year 2050.

1. Open the source code file named NewAge.cpp using Notepad or the text editor of your choice.
2. Declare an integer variable named myNewAge.
3. Declare and initialize an integer variable named myCurrentAge. Initialize this variable with your
current age.
4. Declare and initialize an integer variable named currentYear. Initialize this variable with the value of
the current year. Use four digits for the year.
5. Save this source code file in a directory of your choice, and then make that directory your working
directory.
6. Compile the source code file NewAge.cpp.
7. Execute the program. Record the output of this program.
