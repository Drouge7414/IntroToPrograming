Lab 10-1: Creating a Class in C++

Learning Objective: 10.1

In this lab, you create a programmer-defined class and then use it in a C++ program. The program should
create two Rectangle objects and find their area and perimeter. Use the Circle class that you worked with
in Exercise 10-1 as a guide.

1. Open the class file named Rectangle.cpp using Notepad or the text editor of your choice.
2. In the Rectangle class, create two private attributes named length and width. Both length and
width should be data type double.
3. Write public set methods to set the values for length and width.
4. Write public get methods to retrieve the values for length and width.
5. Write a public calculateArea() method and a public calculatePerimeter() method to
calculate and return the area of the rectangle and the perimeter of the rectangle.
6. Save this class file, Rectangle.cpp, in a directory of your choice, and then open the file named
MyRectangleClassProgram.cpp.
7. In the MyRectangleClassProgram, create two Rectangle objects named rectangle1 and
rectangle2 using the default constructor as you saw in MyEmployeeClassProgram.cpp.
8. Set the length of rectangle1 to 10.0 and the width to 5.0. Set the length of rectangle2 to 7.0
and the width to 3.0.
9. Print the value of rectangle1’s perimeter and area, and then print the value of rectangle2’s
perimeter and area.
10. Save MyRectangleClassProgram.cpp in the same directory as Rectangle.cpp.
11. Compile the source code file MyRectangleClassProgram.cpp.
12. Execute the program.
13. Record the output below.
