Lab 3-1: Using Flowcharts and Pseudocode to Write a C++ Program
Learning Objective: 3.1

In this lab, you use the flowchart and pseudocode in Figure 3-3 to add code to a partially created C++
program. When completed, college admissions officers should be able to use the C++ program to determine
whether to accept or reject a student, based on his or her test score and class rank.

Figure 3-3 Pseudocode for the College Admission program

start
input testScore, classRank
if testScore >= 90 then
if classRank >= 25 then
output "Accept"
else
output "Reject"
endif
else
if testScore >= 80 then
if classRank >= 50 then
output "Accept"
else
output "Reject"
endif
else
if testScore >= 70 then
if classRank >= 75 then
output "Accept"

1. Study the pseudocode in Figure 3-3.
2. Open the source code file named CollegeAdmission.cpp using Notepad or the text editor of your
choice.
3. Declare two integer variables named testScore and classRank.
4. Write the interactive input statements to retrieve a studentâ€™s test score and class rank from the user of
the program. Do not forget to prompt the user for the test score and class rank.
5. The rest of the program is written for you. Save this source code file in a directory of your choice, and
then make that directory your working directory.
6. Compile the source code file CollegeAdmission.cpp.
7. Execute the program by entering 87 for the test score and 60 for the class rank. Record the output of
this program.
8. Execute the program by entering 60 for the test score and 87 for the class rank. Record the output of
this program.
