Lab 8-3: Using Multidimensional Arrays
Learning Objective: 8.4
In this lab, you will complete a C++ program that uses a two-dimensional array to store data for the Building
Block Day Care Center. The program is described in Chapter 8, Exercise 10, in Programming Logic and
Design. The day care center charges varying weekly rates depending on the age of the child and the number
of days per week the child attends. The weekly rates are shown in Table 8-2.

Table 8-2 Weekly rates for Lab 8-3
Age in Years
Days Per Week

1 2 3 4 5
0 30.00 60.00 88.00 115.00 140.00
1 26.00 52.00 70.00 96.00 120.00
2 24.00 46.00 67.00 89.00 110.00
3 22.00 40.00 60.00 75.00 88.00
4 or more 20.00 35.00 50.00 66.00 84.00

The program should allow the user to enter the age of the child and the number of days per week the
child will be at the day care center. The program should output the appropriate weekly rate. The file provided
for this lab contains all of the necessary variable declarations, except the two-dimensional array. You need to
write the input statements and the code that initializes the two-dimensional array, determines the weekly rate,
and prints the weekly rate. Comments in the code tell you where to write your statements.

1. Open the source code file named DayCare.cpp using Notepad or the text editor of your choice.
2. Declare and initialize the two-dimensional array.

3. Write the C++ statements that retrieve the age of the child and the number of days the child will be at
the day care center.
4. Determine and print the weekly rate.
5. Save this source code file in a directory of your choice, and then make that directory your working
directory.
6. Compile the source code file DayCare.cpp.
7. Execute the program.
