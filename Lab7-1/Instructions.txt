Lab 7-1: Opening Files and Performing File Input

Learning Objective: 7.1

In this lab, you open a file and read input from that file in a prewritten C++ program. The program should
read and print the names of flowers and whether they are grown in shade or sun. The data is stored in the
input file named flowers.dat.

1. Open the source code file named Flowers.cpp using Notepad or the text editor of your choice.
2. Declare the variables you will need.
3. Write the C++ statements that will open the input file flowers.dat for reading.
4. Write a while loop to read the input until EOF is reached.
5. In the body of the loop, print the name of each flower and where it can be grown (sun or shade).
6. Save this source code file in a directory of your choice, and then make that directory your working directory.
7. Compile the source code file Flowers.cpp.
8. Execute the program.
