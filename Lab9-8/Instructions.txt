Lab 9-8: Using C++ Built-in Functions 

Learning Objectives: 9.2, 9.8

In this lab, you complete a partially written C++ program that includes built-in functions that convert charac
ters stored in a character array to all uppercase or all lowercase. The program prompts the user to enter nine
characters. For each character in the array, you call the built-in functions tolower() and toupper(). Both of
these functions return a character with the character changed to uppercase or lowercase. Here is an example:
-
char sample1 = 'A';
char sample2 = 'a';
char result1, result2;
result1 = tolower(sample1);
result2 = toupper(sample2);

The source code file provided for this lab includes the necessary variable declarations and the necessary input
and output statements. Comments are included in the file to help you write the remainder of the program.

1. Open the source code file named ChangeCase.cpp using Notepad or the text editor of your choice.
2. Write the C++ statements as indicated by the comments.
3. Save this source code file in a directory of your choice, and then make that directory your working
directory.
4. Compile the source code file ChangeCase.cpp.
5. Execute the program with the following data:
uppercase
LOWERCASE
