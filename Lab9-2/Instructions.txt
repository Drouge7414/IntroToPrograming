In this lab, you complete a partially written C++ program that includes two functions that require a single
parameter. The program continuously prompts the user for an integer until the user enters 0. The program
then passes the value to a function that computes the sum of all the whole numbers from 1 up to and
including the entered number. Next, the program passes the value to another function that computes the
product of all the whole numbers up to and including the entered number. The source code file provided for
this lab includes the necessary variable declarations and the input statement. Comments are included in the
file to help you write the remainder of the program.

1. Open the source code file named SumAndProduct.cpp using Notepad or the text editor of your choice.
2. Write the C++ statements as indicated by the comments.
3. Save this source code file in a directory of your choice, and then make that directory your working
directory.
4. Compile the source code file SumAndProduct.cpp.
5. Execute the program.
