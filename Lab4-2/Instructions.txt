Lab 4-2: Understanding if else Statements

Learning Objectives: 4.1, 4.3

In this lab, you complete a prewritten C++ program that computes the largest and smallest of three integer
values. The three values are â€”50, 53, and 78.

1. Open the file named LargeSmall.cpp using Notepad or the text editor of your choice.
2. Two variables named largest and smallest are declared for you. Use these variables to store the
largest and smallest of the three integer values. You must decide what other variables you will need
and initialize them as appropriate.
3. Write the rest of the program using assignment statements, if statements, or if else statements
as appropriate. There are comments in the code that tell you where you should write your statements.
The output statements are written for you.
4. Compile the program.
5. Execute the program. Your output should be:
The largest value is 78
The smallest value is -50
