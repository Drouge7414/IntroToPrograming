Lab 5-3: Using a for Loop

Learning Objectives: 5.1, 5.3

In this lab, you work with the same C++ program you worked with in Lab 5-1. As in Lab 5-1, the completed
program should print the numbers 0 through 10, along with their values multiplied by 2 and by 10. However,
in this lab, you should accomplish this using a for loop instead of a counter-controlled while loop.

1. Open the source code file named NewMultiply.cpp using Notepad or the text editor of your
choice.
2. Write a for loop that uses the loop control variable to take on the values 0 through 10.
3. In the body of the loop, multiply the value of the loop control variable by 2 and by 10.
4. Save this source code file in a directory of your choice, and then make that directory your working
directory.
5. Compile the source code file NewMultiply.cpp.
6. Execute the program. Is the output the same?
