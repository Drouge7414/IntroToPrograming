Lab 6-3: Parallel Arrays

Learning Objectives: 6.1—6.3

In this lab, you use what you have learned about parallel arrays to complete a partially completed C++
program. The program is described in Chapter 6, Exercise 7, in Programming Logic and Design. The program
should either print the name and price for a coffee add-in from the Jumpin’ Jive Coffee Shop or it should print
the message "Sorry, we do not carry that.".

Read the problem description carefully before you begin. The data file provided for this lab includes the
necessary variable declarations and input statements. You need to write the part of the program that searches
for the name of the coffee add-in(s) and either prints the name and price of the add-in or prints the error
message if the add-in is not found. Comments in the code tell you where to write your statements. You can
use the expanded Mail Order2 program shown in Figure 6-5 as a guide.

1. Open the source code file named JumpinJive.cpp using Notepad or the text editor of your choice.
2. Study the prewritten code to make sure you understand it.
3. Write the code that searches the array for the name of the add-in ordered by the customer.
4. Write the code that prints the name and price of the add-in or the error message, and then write the
code that prints the cost of the total order.
5. Save this source code file in a directory of your choice, and then make that directory your working
directory.
6. Compile the source code file JumpinJive.cpp.
7. Execute the program using the following data and record the output:
Cream
Caramel
Whiskey
chocolate
Chocolate
Cinnamon
Vanilla
