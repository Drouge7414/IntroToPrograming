Lab 8-1: Swapping Values
Learning Objectives: 8.1, 8.2

In this lab, you will complete a C++ program that swaps values stored in three int variables and determines
maximum and minimum values. The C++ file provided for this lab contains the necessary variable
declarations, as well as the input and output statements. You want to end up with the smallest value stored in
the variable named first and the largest value stored in the variable named third. You need to write the
statements that compare the values and swap them if appropriate. Comments included in the code tell you
where to write your statements.

1. Open the source code file named Swap.cpp using the text editor of your choice.
2. Write the statements that test the first two integers, and swap them if necessary.
3. Write the statements that test the second and third integer, and swap them if necessary.
4. Write the statements that test the first and second integers again, and swap them if necessary.
5. Save this source code file in a directory of your choice, and then make that directory your working
directory.
6. Compile the source code file Swap.cpp.
7. Execute the program using the following sets of input values, and record the output:

101 22 â€“23
630 1500 9
21 2 2
