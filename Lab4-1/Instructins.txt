Lab 4-1: Understanding if Statements

Learning Objectives: 4.1–4.3

In this lab, you complete a prewritten C++ program for a carpenter who creates personalized house signs.
The program is supposed to compute the price of any sign a customer orders, based on the following facts:

• The charge for all signs is a minimum of $35.00.
• The first five letters or numbers are included in the minimum charge; there is a $4 charge for each
additional character.

• If the sign is made of oak, add $20.00. No charge is added for pine.
• Black or white characters are included in the minimum charge; there is an additional $15 charge for
gold-leaf lettering.


1. Open the file named HouseSign.cpp using Notepad or the text editor of your choice.
2. You need to declare variables for the following, and initialize them where specified:
• A variable for the cost of the sign initialized to 0.00.
• A variable for the color of the characters initialized to "gold".
• A variable for the wood type initialized with the value "oak".
• A variable for the number of characters initialized with the value 8.
3. Write the rest of the program using assignment statements and if statements as appropriate. The
output statements are written for you.
4. Compile the program.
5. Execute the program. Your output should be: The charge for this sign is $82
Note that you cannot control the number of places that appear after the decimal point until you learn more
about C++ in Chapter 9 of this book
