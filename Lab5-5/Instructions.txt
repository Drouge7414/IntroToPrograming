Lab 5-5: Nesting Loops

Learning Objectives: 5.1, 5.3, 5.5

In this lab, you add nested loops to a C++ program provided with the data files for this book. The program
should print the outline of the letter E, as shown in Figure 5-2. The letter E is printed using asterisks, three
across and five down. This program uses cout << "*"; to print an asterisk and cout << " "; to print a
space.

Figure 5-2 Letter E printed by LetterE.cpp.

1. Open the source code file named LetterE.cpp using Notepad or the text editor of your choice.
2. Write the nested loops to control the number of rows and the number of columns that make up the
letter E.
3. In the loop body, use a nested if statement to decide when to print an asterisk and when to print a
space. The output statements have been written, but you must decide when and where to use them.
4. Save this source code file in a directory of your choice, and then make that directory your working
directory.
5. Compile the source code file LetterE.cpp.
6. Execute the program. Your letter E should look like the letter E in Figure 5-2.
7. Modify the program to change the number of rows from five to seven and the number of columns
from three to five. What does the letter E look like now?
