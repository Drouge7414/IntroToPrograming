Lab 3-2: Writing a Modular Program in C++
Learning Objectives: 3.1, 3.2

In this lab, you add the input and output statements to a partially completed C++ program. When completed,
the user should be able to enter a year, a month, and a day. The program then determines if the date is valid.
Valid years are those that are greater than 0, valid months include the values 1 through 12, and valid days
include the values 1 through 31.

1. Open the source code file named BadDate.cpp using Notepad or the text editor of your choice.
2. Notice that variables have been declared for you.
3. Write the simulated housekeeping() function that contains the prompts and input statements to
retrieve a year, a month, and a day from the user.
4. Include the output statements in the simulated endOfJob() function. The format of the output is as
follows:
month/day/year is a valid date.
or
month/day/year is an invalid date.
5. Save this source code file in a directory of your choice, and then make that directory your working
directory.
6. Compile the source code file BadDate.cpp.
7. Execute the program entering the following date: month = 5, day = 32, year = 2014. Record the
output of this program.
8. Execute the program entering the following date: month = 9, day = 21, year = 2002. Record the
output of this program.
