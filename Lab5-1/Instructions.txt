Lab 5-1: Using a Counter-Controlled while Loop

Learning Objectives: 5.1, 5.2

In this lab, you use a counter-controlled while loop in a C++ program provided with the data files for this
book. When completed, the program should print the numbers 0 through 10, along with their values multiplied
by 2 and by 10. The data file contains the necessary variable declarations and some output statements.

1. Open the source code file named Multiply.cpp using Notepad or the text editor of your choice.
2. Write a counter-controlled while loop that uses the loop control variable to take on the values 0
through 10. Remember to initialize the loop control variable before the program enters the loop.
3. In the body of the loop, multiply the value of the loop control variable by 2 and by 10. Remember to
change the value of the loop control variable in the body of the loop.
4. Save the source code file in a directory of your choice, and then make that directory your working
directory.
5. Compile the source code file Multiply.cpp.
6. Execute the program. Record the output of this program.
